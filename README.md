### **DESCRIPTION**
---

Computer is a great invention in the human era. It perofrmed & evolved with time.
To sit across a device for long hours & doing all the searches and work & reading & surfing the internet was quite aboredom.
Thus, a Graphical User Interface (GUI) was implemented. In GUI, you not only surf internet but also interact with the device.
There are various interfaces available today. However, in this repository the main focus is on TKinter.

### **TKINTER**

Tkinter pronounced as *kinter* is a Python's de-facto standard GUI. It is the standard Python interface to the Tk GUI toolkit.
It provides various options like scorll, menu bars, padding of axes, buttons, frames, labels, widgets, grid labels & many more.
